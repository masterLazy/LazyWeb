# LazyWeb
A new **HTTP** SDK strives to be perfect and easy to use. (I have developed mWeb but I thought it was trash so I decide to create this. ) Both **HTTP Client** and **HTTP Server** is supported in LazyWeb.

## Introduction
LazyWeb is based on **Windows API** and **OpenSSL**. LazyWeb is **multi-threaded**.

## Situation
The development of LazyWeb has only recently begun. It's under development. mLazy drew this picture to show his basic ideas:
